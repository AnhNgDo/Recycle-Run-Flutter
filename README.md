## Inspiration
This mini game is an entry for the [Global Gamers Challenge](https://flutter.dev/global-gamers) - sponsored by Flutter and Global Citizen team. 

Many of us would have heard about the importance of recycling. I wanted to reinforce this message with a game that makes recycling fun, exciting, and even heroic! I'd like players to **laugh, jump, and recycle their way to victory**, realizing that even small actions can make a big difference and learn a thing or two about the great benefits of recycling💚

## What it does
You'll be dashing through vibrant landscapes as a super-powered recycling bin, dodging pesky obstacles and gobbling up recyclables with glee. There are 3 levels that can be unlocked by completing previous level:
- "**Sun, Sand & Recycling**"🥤 - hit the sunny shores, where plastic bottles and aluminum cans are waiting to be rescued!
- "**Paper Town Chaser**"📰 -  zip through a charming town, where paper products are your precious loot!
- "**Circuit City Scavenger**"🔋 - brave the bustling city, where circuit boards and old gadgets await their electronic hero!

## How it was built
- Started with **Flutter Casual Game Toolkit** template - leveraging a lot of the built-in utilities such as audio, menu screens, player progress. Some of the default also look great and fit very well with my desired retro game experience. I also reuse some of the music and sound effects (some of the sfx are super funny!) 🕹️
- **Flame engine** was used for game logic - utilising its powerful infrastructure such as game world, components, animations, special effects, particularly its efficient game loop and collision detection system🔥
- Game assets were sourced and created with help from **open sources community**, as well as AI image tools such as **Image Generator, Stable Diffusion** and good old **Paint.net** image editor 🙏
